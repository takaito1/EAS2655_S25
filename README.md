# EAS2655 : Quantitative techniques for EAS, Spring 2025

Welcome to the EAS2655 repository for Spring 2025! 

We will be using Python in Google Colab as the coding environment for this course. 
No problem if you don't have previous experiences with Python and/or Google Colab. 
Our goal is to develop the fundamental understanding in how we approach data analysis in Earth Sciences. 
Mastering convenient features of Google Colab and Python libraries is NOT the goal of this course. 
The skills we develop will be applicable even if you use different coding environment in the future. 

## Getting started

Point your browser to colab.google
  - To develop a code from scratch, select "New Notebook" icon, and it will open a new jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook will be saved in your google drive under "Colab Notebooks" folder. 
  - To open a previously saved code, select "Open Colab" icon, and it will open a navigation window to open files from different sources.
