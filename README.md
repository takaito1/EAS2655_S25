# EAS2655_S25 : Quantitative techniques for EAS

Welcome to the EAS2655 repository for Spring 2025! 

We will be using Python in Google Colab as the coding environment for this course. 
No problem if you don't have previous experiences with Python and/or Google Colab. 
Our goal is to develop the fundamental understanding in how we approach data analysis in Earth Sciences. 
Mastering all the convenient features of Google Colab and Python libraries is NOT the goal of this course. 
The skills we develop will hopefully applicable even if you use different coding environment in the future.
